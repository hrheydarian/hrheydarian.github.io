excerpt: 'The number of super-resolution localization events corresponding to binding sites on DNA origami structures are not distributed uniformly over the structure. Binding sites on the edge of structures were localized less often than sites in the center. Reliable activation counts per DNA strand can be made via particle fusion.'

DNA-origami nanostructures have shown promising applications in single molecule localization microscopy. They have become a reference standard for benchmarking and for developing new techniques for nanoscopy. Here, we present a pipeline for quantifying the quality of these nano-structures when imaging multiple instances of them using DNA-PAINT technique. We show on several experimental datasets that these structures can have deformations and that the designed binding sites are not equally accessible for the labelled imager strands during the image acquisition process. These limitations result in non-uniform activation of the sites over the origami pattern when fusing the instances into a single reconstruction.
