title: "Three dimensional particle averaging for structural imaging of macromolecular complexes by localization microscopy"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-11-10-paper-smlm_datafusion3d
excerpt: 'We present an approach for 3D particle fusion in localization microscopy which dramatically increases signal-to-noise ratio and resolution in single particle analysis. Our method does not require a structural template, and properly handles anisotropic localization uncertainties. We demonstrate 3D particle reconstructions of the Nup107 subcomplex of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), cross-validated using multiple localization microscopy techniques, as well as two-color 3D reconstructions of the NPC, and reconstructions of DNA-origami tetrahedrons.'
