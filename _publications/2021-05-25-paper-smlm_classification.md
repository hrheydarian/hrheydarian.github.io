title: "Detecting structural heterogeneity in single-molecule localization microscopy data"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-05-25-paper-smlm_classification
excerpt: 'Particle fusion for single molecule localization microscopy improves signal-to-noise ratio and overcomes underlabeling, but ignores structural heterogeneity or conformational variability. We present a-priori knowledge-free unsupervised classification of structurally different particles employing the Bhattacharya cost function as dissimilarity metric. We achieve 96% classification accuracy on mixtures of up to four different DNA-origami structures, detect rare classes of origami occuring at 2% rate, and capture variation in ellipticity of nuclear pore complexes.'
