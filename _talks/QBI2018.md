The Quantitative BioImaging Society seeks to foster the scientific exchange of researchers with interest in quantitative imaging in biological and biomedical sciences. A particular emphasis is to promote interdisciplinary interactions between physicists, engineers, chemists, mathematicians, biologists, etc. One of the main activities to date has been the organization of the Quantitative BioImaging Conference that is held annually at different locations worldwide.   

I had an oral presentation at this conference. Read the abstract [here](https://qbi-space1.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/06204445/2018-Conference-Booklet.pdf).
