I presented two of my latest work at this [conferece](http://www.focusonmicroscopy.org/). The first was our paper on [3D particle averaging](http://www.focusonmicroscopy.org/2021/PDF/1016_Heydarian.pdf) and macromolecular symmetry detection for single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) data. The second was our submitted paper on [Detecting Structural Heterogeneity in Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy Data](http://www.focusonmicroscopy.org/2021/PDF/1015_Huijben.pdf).
