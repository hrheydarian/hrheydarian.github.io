I am a postdoc reasearcher at the [Computational Imaging group](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/faculty-of-applied-sciences/about-faculty/departments/imphys/research/life-sciences) of [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) since November 2019 (see my TU Delft profile [here](https://research.tudelft.nl/en/persons/h-heydarian)). The project I am working on, aims at shifting the obtainable resolution of localization microscopy towards 1 nm using novel data-driven super-resolution reconstruction schemes and by employing prior knowledge. More specifcally, my main objectives are to reconstruct super-resolution images from incomplete data in order to be able to estimate underlying structures.

I did my PhD at Delft University of Technology between 2015-2019 under the supervision of Professor [Bernd Rieger](http://homepage.tudelft.nl/z63s8/) and [Sjoerd Stallinga](https://homepage.tudelft.nl/99s1c/) and defended my thesis in March 2020 (see TU Delft news coverage [here](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2020/tnw/hamidreza-heydarian-successfully-defended-his-phd-thesis) and [here](https://twitter.com/tudelft/status/1239953066968911874)). 

Before comming to the Netherlands, I studied master of [Visual Computing](http://www.master-visual-computing.de/) at Saarland University in Germany. That was a specialized program on image processing and computer vision. I did my master thesis on the application of partial differential equation to perform ridge clustering under the supervision of [Prof. Joachim Weickert](https://www.mia.uni-saarland.de/weickert/index.shtml).
