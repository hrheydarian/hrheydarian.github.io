I am a postdoc reasearcher at the Computational Imaging group of Delft University of Technology. The project I am working on, aims at shifting the obtainable resolution of localization microscopy towards 1 nm using novel data-driven super-resolution reconstruction schemes and by employing prior knowledge. More specifcally, my main objectives are to reconstruct super-resolution images from incomplete data in order to be able to estimate underlying structures.
