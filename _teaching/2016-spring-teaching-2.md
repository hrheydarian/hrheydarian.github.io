The aim of the course Computational Science is to introduce the student in the use of models and simulation techniques for research into physical phenomena and processes. First, the student is taught to program in a programming environment: MATLAB. The students then carry out a number of assignments that illustrate different aspects of the use of simulations within physics. Based on this, the student also becomes acquainted with a number of frequently used numerical techniques, the stability of the methods used and the error estimation.
