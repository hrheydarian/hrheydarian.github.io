This year, I redesigned the course final projects. Each group (of two students) need to select a topic, implement a paper, write a report and present it and the end of the course. The final projects are all publically available here: [https://qiweb.tudelft.nl/adip/final_projects/](https://qiweb.tudelft.nl/adip/final_projects/).

Additionally, I revised the labworks based on the feedbacks from the last year. The labworks were also made publically available at [https://qiweb.tudelft.nl/adip/](https://qiweb.tudelft.nl/adip/)). The students now required to work with git in order to submit and maintain their code and implementations. This year the course was completely virtual and I helped the students via Microsft Teams.
