The aim of this course is to teach the students to acquire in-depth knowledge of state-of-the-art image processing techniques. By the end of this course the students will be able to solve advanced problems addressing the theory of image processing by combining mathematical skills and physical insight.
For this course, I designed the programming assignments (assignments are publically available at [https://qiweb.tudelft.nl/adip/](https://qiweb.tudelft.nl/adip/)) covering diverse topics in image processing and also helped the instructors as a teaching assistant.
